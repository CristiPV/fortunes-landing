TODO: * Write the Business Plan - I need to do some research about what a Business Plan
        is and what information I need to provide with it. Afterwards, I need to write
        the plan.
      * Create an empty / default React App - I have decided to use a React App for the
        frontend part of the assignment. For today, I want to only create the default
        React App which I can later use to make the wheel.
Summary: I managed to do the research about the Business Plan and write a brief one which
         describes the product, its target audience, how it will make profit and what costs
         need to be taken into consideration.
         I also created a React App in a folder called 'frontend' ( I plan to have the following
         folder structure for the project: docs - documentation, frontend - frontend app,
         backend - the backend api ).

ENTRY 2

Date: 07/05/2021 - Time Spent: 04hrs, 48mins
TODO: * Create the wheel - I need to figure out a way to create a wheel, in the style of
        a pie chart, which can take a number 'n' and create 'n' amount of equal "slices"
        within it ( I am thinking to use Canvas for this ).
      * Think of how to implement the "spin" - I have thought of either having an moving
        indicator which will move from "slice" to "slice" until it stops on one, or having
        a static indicator and making the wheel rotate.
Summary: I managed to draw the wheel in canvas with any 'n' amount of items and I also managed
         to find a way to draw a little indicator and animate it so that it spins for any given
         amount of rotations ( 'x' * PI, where, for example, 2 * PI would be 360Â° = full rotation )
         ** One problem I encountered was the fact that I wanted the indicator 
         to slow down as it approached the end of the animation and I figured I could use some sort
         of exponential function. Due to the fact that I haven't worked with this level of Maths in a 
         long time, I felt the need to call a friend who studies Maths and see if he could come up with
         a mathematical function for my use case. Thankfully he did, and I ended up implementing that in 
         my code.

ENTRY 3

Date: 08/05/2021 - Time Spent: 2hrs, 30mins
TODO: * Create a button that triggers the spin.
      * Figure out a way of selecting which prize is won - I am thinking that I can make it so that
        the winning prize is decided the moment the button is pushed by using a function to randomly
        choose one item. I want to further refine it so that once it is decided which prize the indicator
        has to end up pointing to, a function will generate a random position on the item's 'slice'
        of the wheel so it simulates a real wheel ( and the indicator doesn't always end up in the
        center of the item ).
Summary: I created a button that triggers the indicator to spin around the wheel until it reaches
         a random location on one of the items.
         I also imported react-bootstrap and did a bit of styling on the page.

ENTRY 4
*------*
Date: 09/05/2021 - Time Spent: 1hr, 59mins
TODO: * I want to add a 'chance' for each of the wheel items ( basically the odds of that item being selected )
        and then I will have to rework the way in which the way items are being chosen ( because now all of them
        have the same odds ) to work with this 'chance' factor. I have an idea of how to implement this but I want
        to look more into how this can be achieved.
      * I want to block the 'spin' button so it cannot be triggered during an ongoing spin.
Summary: I looked on some game dev forums and I found a nice algorithm for randomly selecting an item
         based on a weight ( basically a predisposition of that item being chosen ) and I managed to 
         adapt it to my use case.
         I also managed to lock the spin button so it cannot be used for the duration of one spin.

ENTRY 5

Date: 10/05/2021 - Time Spent: 04hrs, 38mins
TODO: * I want to add a toast notification congratulating the user for the prize he received
      * I want to look into how to do some more complex styling in canvas to make the wheel look better
Summary: Issue: I have been trying to work with the react-bootstrap toast component and for some reason
         it does not work how it is meant to.
         Fix: I had to downgrade 'bootstrap' dependency from 5.0.0 to 4.6.0 ( the reason is that on the
         website of react-bootstrap I saw that current version of 'react-bootstrap' is 1.5.2 and it works 
         with 'bootstrap' version of 4.6.0 )
         Issue: The spin button no longer get disabled with this version of 'bootstrap'
         Fix: I added the 'disabled' attribute to the html element of the button when I wanted it disabled
         and removed it when I wanted it enabled.
         In the end, I managed to both create the toast, notifying the user of the won prize, and style the
         wheel along with the indicator after some long struggles to find the right shapes and colors :P

ENTRY 6
*------*
Date: 11/05/2021 - Time Spent: 3hrs, 17mins
TODO: * I want to write the Readme file which describes the project, how to install and run it.
      * I want to take a look at the comments I wrote so far, remove the unnecessary ones and add some more 
        where they are needed.
Summary: I managed to write the README.md file along with some more documentation, which I linked in it, as
         well as rewriting the comments for my currently existing components.
         I also replaced the icon and title that of the app and removed the unused png files.

ENTRY 7
*------*
Date: 13/05/2021 - Time Spent: 3hrs, 23mins
TODO: * I want to implement React Router, turn the current app into one page and create another page where 
        the history of all prizes won can be displayed ( as of right now, I think it will only be the history
        since the app has been launched, later I am thinking to even save and retrieve the history list
        from a database ).
Summary: Issue: after making two pages ( WheelPage and HistoryPage ) I couldn't switch between the two by
         changing the path in the browser.
         Fix: When I create the '<Route>'s I need to use the 'exact' keyword in order for the router to look
         for the exact path instead of using the partial matching. ( even though partial matching should be
         just fine for my routes :/ )
         Issue: I implemented the history, although every time I leave the history page, it resets.
         Fix: I just had to move the prize history list to App.js and pass it to both pages ( it 
         will be completely removed once I implement the database, though ).
         I managed to implement React Router and create two pages: the wheel page which contains the 
         wheel component and a button to go to the history page, and the history page which contains
         a table with all the winnings that have occurred in that session and a back button.

ENTRY 8
*------*
Date: 14/05/2021 - Time Spent: 2hrs, 52mins
TODO: * Clean up and finish the history feature
      * Design an ERD
      * Create a Springboot project and start working on the API
Summary: I added comments on the two page components and updated the README. Afterwards, I created a
         MySQL RDS Instance on AWS. I created an ERD of how I currently want the database to look like 
         and wrote a creation script which I then ran on the db to test it.
         I created a new Springboot project with the Spring Initializr through IntelliJ, set up
         the configuration to connect to my DB and created the model classes based on the ERD.

ENTRY 9
*------*
Date: 15/05/2021 - Time Spent: 5hrs, 14mins
TODO: * Fix ERD ( I mistakenly used the wrong relationship line in between my 2 tables )
      * Finish API.
      * Look into CORS
Summary: I fixed the ERD to now contain the correct relationship and data types.
         I finished implementing the REST API and tested it with Postman to make sure it all works
         as intended. I also wrote javadoc comments in the relevant places and created a 
         population script which provides a few starting prizes.
         I updated the README file with relevant information about the API.
