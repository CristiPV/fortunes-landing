TODO: * Write the Business Plan - I need to do some research about what a Business Plan
        is and what information I need to provide with it. Afterwards, I need to write
        the plan.
      * Create an empty / default React App - I have decided to use a React App for the
        frontend part of the assignment. For today, I want to only create the default
        React App which I can later use to make the wheel.
Summary: I managed to do the research about the Business Plan and write a brief one which
         describes the product, its target audience, how it will make profit and what costs
         need to be taken into consideration.
         I also created a React App in a folder called 'frontend' ( I plan to have the following
         folder structure for the project: docs - documentation, frontend - frontend app,
         backend - the backend api ).

ENTRY 2

Date: 07/05/2021 - Time Spent: 04hrs, 48mins
TODO: * Create the wheel - I need to figure out a way to create a wheel, in the style of
        a pie chart, which can take a number 'n' and create 'n' amount of equal "slices"
        within it ( I am thinking to use Canvas for this ).
      * Think of how to implement the "spin" - I have thought of either having an moving
        indicator which will move from "slice" to "slice" until it stops on one, or having
        a static indicator and making the wheel rotate.
Summary: I managed to draw the wheel in canvas with any 'n' amount of items and I also managed
         to find a way to draw a little indicator and animate it so that it spins for any given
         amount of rotations ( 'x' * PI, where, for example, 2 * PI would be 360Â° = full rotation )
         ** One problem I encountered was the fact that I wanted the indicator 
         to slow down as it approached the end of the animation and I figured I could use some sort
         of exponential function. Due to the fact that I haven't worked with this level of Maths in a 
         long time, I felt the need to call a friend who studies Maths and see if he could come up with
         a mathematical function for my use case. Thankfully he did, and I ended up implementing that in 
         my code.
