TODO: * Write the Business Plan - I need to do some research about what a Business Plan
        is and what information I need to provide with it. Afterwards, I need to write
        the plan.
      * Create an empty / default React App - I have decided to use a React App for the
        frontend part of the assignment. For today, I want to only create the default
        React App which I can later use to make the wheel.
Summary: I managed to do the research about the Business Plan and write a brief one which
         describes the product, its target audience, how it will make profit and what costs
         need to be taken into consideration.
         I also created a React App in a folder called 'frontend' ( I plan to have the following
         folder structure for the project: docs - documentation, frontend - frontend app,
         backend - the backend api ).

ENTRY 2

Date: 07/05/2021 - Time Spent: 04hrs, 48mins
TODO: * Create the wheel - I need to figure out a way to create a wheel, in the style of
        a pie chart, which can take a number 'n' and create 'n' amount of equal "slices"
        within it ( I am thinking to use Canvas for this ).
      * Think of how to implement the "spin" - I have thought of either having an moving
        indicator which will move from "slice" to "slice" until it stops on one, or having
        a static indicator and making the wheel rotate.
Summary: I managed to draw the wheel in canvas with any 'n' amount of items and I also managed
         to find a way to draw a little indicator and animate it so that it spins for any given
         amount of rotations ( 'x' * PI, where, for example, 2 * PI would be 360Â° = full rotation )
         ** One problem I encountered was the fact that I wanted the indicator 
         to slow down as it approached the end of the animation and I figured I could use some sort
         of exponential function. Due to the fact that I haven't worked with this level of Maths in a 
         long time, I felt the need to call a friend who studies Maths and see if he could come up with
         a mathematical function for my use case. Thankfully he did, and I ended up implementing that in 
         my code.

TODO: * Create a button that triggers the spin.
      * Figure out a way of selecting which prize is won - I am thinking that I can make it so that
        the winning prize is decided the moment the button is pushed by using a function to randomly
        choose one item. I want to further refine it so that once it is decided which prize the indicator
        has to end up pointing to, a function will generate a random position on the item's 'slice'
        of the wheel so it simulates a real wheel ( and the indicator doesn't always end up in the
        center of the item ).
Summary: I created a button that triggers the indicator to spin around the wheel until it reaches
         a random location on one of the items.
         I also imported react-bootstrap and did a bit of styling on the page.

ENTRY 4

Date: 09/05/2021 - Time Spent: 1hr, 59mins
TODO: * I want to add a 'chance' for each of the wheel items ( basically the odds of that item being selected )
        and then I will have to rework the way in which the way items are being chosen ( because now all of them
        have the same odds ) to work with this 'chance' factor. I have an idea of how to implement this but I want
        to look more into how this can be achieved.
      * I want to block the 'spin' button so it cannot be triggered during an ongoing spin.
Summary: TO BE COMPLETED
