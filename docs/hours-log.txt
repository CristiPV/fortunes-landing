TODO: * Write the Business Plan - I need to do some research about what a Business Plan
        is and what information I need to provide with it. Afterwards, I need to write
        the plan.
      * Create an empty / default React App - I have decided to use a React App for the
        frontend part of the assignment. For today, I want to only create the default
        React App which I can later use to make the wheel.
Summary: I managed to do the research about the Business Plan and write a brief one which
         describes the product, its target audience, how it will make profit and what costs
         need to be taken into consideration.
         I also created a React App in a folder called 'frontend' ( I plan to have the following
         folder structure for the project: docs - documentation, frontend - frontend app,
         backend - the backend api ).
