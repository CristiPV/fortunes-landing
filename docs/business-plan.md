#### **How will the product generate income**

On each spin, the house will have a statistical advantage, which is also what makes the game a gamble.\
The participation price will always be higher than the average cost of the prizes. Thus, the profit will consist of the total amount of money after paying for all the prizes won.\
For example, if a player pays the entry cost of 30DKK and they win a prize worth 20DKK, there will be a profit of 10DKK. Moreover, the player might be motivated to win a rarer prize and will play again. At the end of the day, if the game records 1000 spins, that would be a total of 30.000DKK. With the average prize cost of 20DKK, there will be a turnover of around 10.000DKK on average.

#### **Costs for maintaining the business**
